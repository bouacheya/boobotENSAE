Generating Booba Lyrics with GPT2. Projet for the ML for NLP course at ENSAE Paris (M2).

This project aims to build a pipeline to train a Natural Language Processing model to mimick the songwriting of one or several artists.
After data scraping and some exploratory analysis of the obtained song lyrics, two models are deployed and presented : one simple but underwhelming LSTM network as well as a fine-tuning of french GPT-2. Two types of generation are tried : from scratch and from a user-prompted sentence initialization. We evaluated our results qualitatively by asking people to guess whether a sentence has been written by the rapper we picked or our model.

You can try to find outputs from our model among other Booba's punchlines in the following gform : https://forms.gle/rbfDhCKEB6GMuYQc8
